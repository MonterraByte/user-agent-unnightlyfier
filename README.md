# User Agent UnNightlyfier

A Firefox addon that changes the version number in the user agent of Nightly (and Beta) versions of Firfox to match the release version of Firefox, which allows using those versions without making your fingerprint (much) more unique.

Download: [Firefox Addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-unnightlyfier/)

Important: Firefox Beta users should go to the addon preferences and tick the appropriate checkbox, as there's no automatic detection.
